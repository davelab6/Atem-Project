# Proposals

This is our *main tool to guide progress* in the Atem-Project. These documents
describe the planning of additions, enhancements or changes to the project.
They are the base of technical discussions and later serve as guidance in the
implementation process. After implementation they will **document design choices
that have been made.**

## Iterative and incremental development

Prepare to find some rough reads in here. The proposals are basically synonymous
to **"work in progress."** We don't believe that a reasonably complex piece of
software can be planned and then written in a top-down fashion like in the
[Waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). Instead,
software-development is done in [iterative and incremental processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development).
The proposals here are no exception, and as such we should treat them as living
documents.
