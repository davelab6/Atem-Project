# Proposals

This is our *main tool to guide progress* in the Atem-Project. These documents
describe the planning of additions, enhancements or changes to the project.
They are the base of technical discussions and later serve as guidance in the
implementation process. After implementation they will document design choices
that have been made.

Prepare to find some rough reads in here. This is basically synonymous to "work in progress".
