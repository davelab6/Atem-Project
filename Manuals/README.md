# Manuals

Step by step guides to accomplish certain tasks. These may become outdated
sooner or later, however, they should have an audience by the time of their
writing, that means, the demand should justify the effort.

Updating of manuals will also happen if there is actual demand. Often, an
old manual can still be a valuable source of knowledge.
