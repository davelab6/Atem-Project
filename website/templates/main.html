            We will provide gradually more advanced access to the software internals, and by being libre,
            thereâ€™s no limits to how deep you can go. We offer the potential for <strong>new ways of
            working</strong> and <strong>new ways to solve design problems</strong>.

            Fonts for the world! Atem is an infrastructure project that will have the most impact in
            the parts of the world that need big fonts with 1,000s or 10,000s of glyphs.
            </p><p>
            And Atem can be much more than making fonts, build your own creative
            applications using Atem concepts and tooling.

            We have a lot to do <strong>for all levels of experience</strong>,

            <p>Links to the 3 most recent news entires. Is there a difference between news and blog? I think we have no blog, and news should be kept short.</p>
