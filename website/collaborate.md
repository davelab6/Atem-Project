# Collaborate

Ways to collaborate are manifold and we are grateful for any of it. This
is inspiration for anyone who is interested in helping the Atem-Project.

Of course, this list is not exhaustive.<br />
If you have another idea on how to collaborate [make contact]({{ url_for('__root__', filename='help.md') }}) and let us know!


## Participate in the Community

Use our stuff and talk about it. Talk with us, talk with others, play,
learn, build, share. We are open for everyone and we want your feedback.


## <a name="writing">Be a Writer</a>

For the contents of this site, the documentation and the conversion of visitors,
we need **technical writing** and **copywriting**. Whether you feel more
comfortable with reviewing and rewriting or if you prefer to write new texts,
we're open for all.

Atem needs authoring, jump in and help out!

We use the [Atem-Project GitHub repository](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project)
as the backend of this site. Ask us if you don't know how to work with that.


## Develop with Atem

Look at the [Applications]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }}) that we're
building and see the technology we've build for that. If you get inspired
and a have an idea yourself *it is your turn to make it!* Use the Atem modules and
see how far you get. Our modules will improve from your feedback.

Thanks for being bold!

## Develop Atem

You like the project and share our [vision]({{ url_for('content/Vision:index') }})?
You can learn, build, invent and improve Atem directly. Be sure to contact
us before you start a big addition or rewrite. Read the [contribution guidelines](#) **FIXME: missing link target**.
Ask us anything, don't speculate. *We are glad to help you getting started.*

Atem is yet mostly written in JavaScript, though we have also tasks that can
be done without writing code at all, you can help on higher levels.
E.g. **Language design** for the next *Property Language*, finding **better algorithms**,
or generally help writing [Proposals]({{ url_for('content/Proposals:index') }}).
I'm sure we can ways find a **math challenge** as well.


## Support Us

Have a look at the [Support Us]({{ url_for('__root__', filename='support-us.md') }}) page, if you think more of a *"remote"* approach to collaboration.
