# Help

*this is a stub*

To not build this help section without knowing what kind of help is actually needed,
we'd like you to ask you kindly to help us in helping you.

## What kind of help do you need?

Please contact us. The best way is to file an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project/issues)
at GitHub.

## Contact Channels

* The GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project/issues)
* Ask [@AtemProject](https://twitter.com/AtemProject) on Twitter
* Post a qestion in [Metapolator on G+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110027004108709154749)
* Should we use [freenode #atem](irc://irc.freenode.net/atem)?
* We could maybe use a https://disqus.com/ forum on this page, but I'd prefer a solution with less lock-in of our data. Hosted by someone else is fine though.

## todo: Make a FAQ

Where can we collect questions that are frequently ask?
