# History

In the beginning was Metapolator with which Atem shares its
<a href="http://metapolator.com/home/#project-history" target="_blank">early history</a>.
There's no need to reproduce it here.

## How Atem Began

The technology invented for Metapolator showed to be generic enough to be
used in a broad range of applications, while Metapolator itself has a
very tightly defined product vision and UI/UX concept. This created a
bad situation for the technology side and the Metapolator-Application.

The decision was to take the fancy technology out of the Metapolator repository
and to organize it in sub-modules. This would make it a good environment for more
general, **experimental application development** using our model abstractions and
that way it would have a high potential as **source for ideas and solutions** that
could feed back into Metapolator.

This work was carried out by Lasse in early 2016. We gave it the
name **Atem Tooling Expressive Models**

* A recursive acronym.
* Reads backwards *meta*, our eternal inspiration is METAFONT.
* It is the German word for "breath", which has a nice positive meaning
and reminds of idioms like *"to breathe new life into sth."* and that
*we are all connected via the Ether through our breath* :-).
