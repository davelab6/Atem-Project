# Support Atem

Atem is a project that creates [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).

> “Free software” means software that *respects users' freedom and community.*
Roughly, it means that the users have **the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.**
Thus, “free software” is *a matter of liberty, not price*. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” **as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”**.
We sometimes call it “libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis.

Therefore, funding our work is not as straight forward as selling proprietary licenses.

If you like [what]({{url_for('content/Vision:index')}}) we [do]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }}),
and want us to **keep doing it** or if you use our software in a professional workflow then
**fund&nbsp;us**. With more funds we can advance Atem more steady and faster. Consider one of
the suggestions below to support us.

Of course, this list is not exhaustive.<br />
If you have another idea on how to support us, [make contact]({{url_for('__root__', filename='help.md')}}) and let us know!

## Become a Patron

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon):
> Patreon is a *crowd-funding platform* popular with YouTube content creators,
musicians, and webcomic artists. It allows artists to *obtain funding from
their fans or patrons*, on a **recurring basis**, or **per work of art**.

## Contracting

Contact [Lasse](http://graphicore.de/en/page/lasse) who is free for contracting,
especially if you want a project of yours to be build with Atem technology or
if you want to sponsor a particular feature.

As appropriate, we can help you finding other developers who'd like to fill in.

## Spread the Word

You would render us a great favor just by sending a link out to a friend of yours, who you think might be interested.

If you happen to be a *blogger* or a *journalist* and are interested in featuring the project, we'll **gladly answer** all your questions.

## Collaborate
