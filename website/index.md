# Atem Tooling Expressive Models

We explore new data models and make good tooling for this.

Our aim is making software that empowers the user, that is simple to use
by default but is unlimited when more might is needed. Software that
helps the user to grow some more knowledge.

The root of Atem is [Metapolator](http://metapolator.com) and our focus
is on making better tools for **type design and typography**. But, Atem is
not limited to any specific use. As such we build big applications and
smaller tech-demos that may spark inspiration for other domains as well.

For more details see [Vision]({{ url_for('content/Vision:index') }}).

## Community and Free Software

Atem is all about making great and Free Software—**“free” as in “free speech,”** not as in “free beer”—we
collaborate as a community, using git as our main tool.
The [contents](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project) and
[code](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Webgenerator) of this website
are hosted on GitGub. Think of it like a Wiki, but with worklfow for collaboration
as in Open Source Software.

Of course all source code of our [sub-projects]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }})
is on GitHub, too. If you are interested in joining our community
see the [Collaboration]({{ url_for('__root__', filename='collaborate.md') }}) and
[Support Us]({{ url_for('__root__', filename='support-us.md') }}) pages as an
inspiration for what you can do.

## Project Communication

A big part of this website is dedicated to project management and documentation
of Atem. As such, the [Project]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }}),
[Concepts]({{ url_for('content/Concepts:index') }}),
[Proposals]({{ url_for('content/Proposals:index') }}) and
[Manuals]({{ url_for('content/Manuals:index') }}) sections
are there to help us organizing our work and to help you learning about this project.

We strive to be **open and transparent**, most of our discussions are held
publicly on the [Issue Tracker of Atem-Project](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project/issues)
or if appropriate on the issue tracker of a sub-project.
