# Atem Tooling Expressive Models

We make power tools for creative minds by exploring new data models and creating sublime tooling.

The **core task** of the current phase is developing the **Atem-CPS** technology
stack and to prove the superiority of the [concept]({{ url_for('content/Concepts', filename='Atem-CPS.md') }})
for complex design tasks like parametric type design.

Our aim is making software that *empowers the user*; that is *simple to use
by default but unlimited when more might is needed*. Software that
helps the user to **grow more knowledge and to become more skillful.**

See the [Projects]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }}) page for our actual output.

### Fonts for the world!

The root of Atem is [Metapolator](http://metapolator.com) and our focus
is on making better tools for **type design and typography**.
Atem is an infrastructure project that will have the most impact in
the parts of the world with *complex scripts* that need *big fonts*
with 1,000s or 10,000s of glyphs.

### More than fonts.

Atem is not limited to any specific use. We build big applications and
smaller tech-demos to spark inspiration for **other domains.**<br />
*Build your own creative applications using Atem concepts and tooling.*

See [Vision]({{ url_for('content/Vision:index') }}) for more details.

## Community and Free Software

Atem is all about making great and Free Software—**“free” as in “free speech,”** not as in “free beer”—we
collaborate as a community, using git as our main tool.
The [contents](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project) and
[code](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Webgenerator) of this website
are hosted on GitHub. Think of it like a **Wiki**, but with a workflow
as in Open Source Software.

Of course all source code of our [sub-projects]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }})
is on GitHub, too. If you are interested in joining our community
see the [Collaboration]({{ url_for('__root__', filename='collaborate.md') }}) and
[Support Us]({{ url_for('__root__', filename='support-us.md') }}) pages as an
inspiration for what you can do.

## Project Communication

A big part of this website is dedicated to project management and documentation
of Atem. The [Project]({{ url_for('content/Sub-Projects:index') }}),
[Concepts]({{ url_for('content/Concepts:index') }}),
[Proposals]({{ url_for('content/Proposals:index') }}) and
[Manuals]({{ url_for('content/Manuals:index') }}) sections
are there to help us organizing our work and to help you learning about this project.

We strive to be **open and transparent**, most of our discussions are held
publicly on the [Issue Tracker of Atem-Project](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project/issues)
or if appropriate on the issue tracker of a sub-project.
