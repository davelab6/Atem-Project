# Atem-Project
**A**tem—**T**ooling **E**xpressive **M**odels: This is the central hub of the project and [host](./tree/gh-pages) of its website . We will guide the project (discussions, community, roadmaps etc.) from here.

## The Atem-Project is a collection of sub-projects:

The separation into Applications, Main Libraries and Basic/Helper Libraries is somewhat arbitrary, don't derive to much meaning from it.

### Applications

* [Metapolator](https://github.com/metapolator/metapolator): Design fonts and font families faster; Metapolator is the origin of Atem ([website](http://metapolator.com )).
* [Bauhaus-Emblem-Font](https://github.com/graphicore/Bauhaus-Emblem-Font): Technology demo, learning tool, next generation (type-)design Application.

### Main Libraries

The building blocks for Atem-Applications. 

* [ufoJS](https://github.com/graphicore/ufoJS/): Javascript API for the **U**nified **F**ont **O**bject ([website](http://lib.ufojs.org)).
* [Atem-IO](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-IO): simple, unified input/outout API for JavaScript. Includes API adapters and tools.
* [Atem-Pen-Case](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Pen-Case): JavaScript API-implementation of the Segment-Pen-Protocol and Point-Pen-Protocol plus a collection of pens.
* [Atem-Property-Language](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Property-Language): Language to define CPS property values; includes the formulae language of Atem-MOM.
* [Atem-CPS](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-CPS): CPS—**C**ascading **P**roperties **S**heets and OMA—**O**bject **M**odel **A**PI
* [Atem-MOM](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-MOM): MOM—**M**etapolator **O**bject **M**odel 
* [obtainJS](https://github.com/graphicore/obtainJS): Framework to unify synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript.

### Basic/Helper Libraries

These are libraries that are used throughout many of the Atem projects more infrastructure than innovation.

* [Atem-Errors](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Errors): Library commonly used by Atem-Project for Error-Class creation.
* [Atem-CPS-whitelisting](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-CPS-whitelisting): Atem Project: lightweight dependency to prepare objects for usage within Atem-CPS; whitelisting accessible properties.
* [Atem-Math-Tools](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Math-Tools): Collection of (2d graphics) math modules used in Atem.
* [Atem-RequireJS-Config](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-RequireJS-Config/): common RequireJS configuration for all Atem sub-projects.
