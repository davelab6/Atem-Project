# Atem-Project

**A**temâ€”**T**ooling **E**xpressive **M**odels: This is the central hub of
the project and [host](./tree/gh-pages) of its [website](http://atem.graphicore.de).

Visit http://atem.graphicore.de to learn more about Atem Project.

We will guide the project (documentation, discussions, community, roadmaps etc.) from here.

## Wiki

The website is updated whenever a commit is pushed to the master branch,
using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/graphicore/Atem-Project). It works
like a Wiki, but with a git workflow based on Pull-Requests. You can use
GitHub like a backend for the website.

The workflow is roughly like:

1. Clone this repository.
* Create a new branch named after your intentions.
* Make your changes, you can do this from the GitHub web interface.
* Make a Pull-Request.

Use the issue-tracker of this GitHub repository to discuss any questions/topics about Atem.
When you have made a Pull Request, we can use the forum of that PR to discuss your changes.

## Build

To build the website yourself on your computer or to run a preview, you
should have a look at and use [Atem-Webgenerator](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Webgenerator).
