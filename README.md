# Atem-Project
Atem—Tooling Expressive Models: This acts as the hub of the project and hosts its website.

## There are now some first stub-sub-projects (mostly dysfunctional at the moment):

* [Atem-CPS](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-CPS): CPS—Cascading Properties Sheets and OMA—Object Model API
* [Atem-IO](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-IO): simple, unified input/outout API for JavaScript. Includes API adapters and tools
* [Atem-Property-Language](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Property-Language): Language to define CPS property values; includes the formulae language of MOM
* [Atem-Errors](https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Errors): Library commonly used by Atem-Project for Error-Class creation.

## Projects that predate Atem but can be seen as a part of Atem:

* [obtainJS](https://github.com/graphicore/obtainJS): Framework to unify synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript.
* [ufoJS](https://github.com/graphicore/ufoJS/): Javascript API for the Unified Font Object http://lib.ufojs.org
* [metapolator](https://github.com/metapolator/metapolator): Design fonts and font families faster http://metapolator.com Metapolator is the origin of Atem
